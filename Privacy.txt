Thank you for using Student Organizer (SO). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

Information Collection

We do not collect any personally identifiable information ("PII") from you when you use the Service. The Service operates on a local basis, and all information provided by you remains local to your device. We do not track, store, or record any information that you input into the Service.

Use of Information

Any information entered into the Service, including but not limited to text, images, or other data, is solely processed locally on your device. We do not access, analyze, or transmit this information in any way.

Disclosure of Information

Since we do not collect or store any information you input into the Service, we do not disclose any information to third parties.

Data Security

We take reasonable measures to secure the information you input into the Service, but it's important to note that because the information stays local to your device, the security of that data ultimately depends on the security measures you have in place on your device.

Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.
